An array is a contiguous, unbreaking memory space. A computer will store this as a singular number - understood as a single type in a row.

We can think of it as a slot in memory to store an array of number, but underneath the hood it is a contiguous number of zeros and ones.

A traditional array does not have the following methods: `insertion`, `delete`. These are methods added onto an implementation of an array.
