title: 'Big O Notation'

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

Often it will help us make decisions about what data structures and algorithms to use. Knowing how they will perform can greatly help create the best possible program out there.
