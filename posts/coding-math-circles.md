title: 'Circles, Ellipses and Lissajous curves'
---

Let's try animate our object in more interesting ways.

Here we move the object in a circle.

To know the coordinates of the circle circumference, we can calculate the points by using some trigonomtery:

To animate in an ellipse shape, we can adjust the radius

And to create lissajous curves, we can also adjust the angle and speed on the x and y axis

We can also layout a bunch of object in a circle
