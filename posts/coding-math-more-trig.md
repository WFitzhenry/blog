Let's use our trigometric functions to animate an object based on values we get from sin function.
We need to know three values to make an object move up or down smoothly.

1. The centre position
2. How far to move the object in either direction
3. How fast to move to move the object.

Here we animate the circle moving up and down by a sin value of the offset amount.
